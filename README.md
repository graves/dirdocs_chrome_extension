# dirdocs Chrome Extension 🧩

This Chrome extension enhances GitHub’s directory views by swapping commit messages with **per-file descriptions** generated by [dirdocs](https://github.com/graves/dirdocs).

It allows you to see exactly what each file does — directly in the GitHub UI.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 **Auto-load**: If a repo contains a `.dirdocs.nuon` file in its root, the extension automatically fetches it.
- 🖊️ **Swap commit messages**: Replaces GitHub’s last commit column with documentation text.
- 🕹️ **Toggle**: Enable/disable per repo with a simple switch in the popup.
- 📂 **Upload override**: Upload a local `.dirdocs.nuon` to override the repo’s version.
- 💬 **Custom tooltip**: Hover a description to view the full text (no truncation).
- 🎨 **Modern theme**: Settings panel styled with a pastel / chalk “Jellybeans” color scheme.
